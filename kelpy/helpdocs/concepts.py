FUNCTIONS
Kelpy is what is called a "Polish prefix" style of language; this means that the
function operators go before the arguments. For example, if we want to add the
numbers 2 and 3, we would do:
    {+ 2 3}
It may seem funny at first, but you'll get used to it!

MATH
There is plenty of support for math with numbers in Kelpy! The following
operators are all fully implemented for numbers:
    +   add
    -   subtract
    *   multiply
    /   divide
    %   modulo
Any of these can be used with any number of arguments. The operation will be
applied to the arguments in order from left to right.

comparison = '''\
COMPARISON
Logical comparisons can be very useful, so of course Kelpy supports it. These
comparison operations will return boolean values:
    ==  equality
    !=  inequality
    <   less than
    >   greater than
    <=  less than or equal
    >=  greater than or equal
